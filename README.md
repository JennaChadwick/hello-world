Tutorial repository for homework 4 of Software Eng

Hello! I am Jenna Chadwick, and this is my second time using GitHub.
This is my first time dealing with the command line portion, however, since PyCharm supports GitHub by default and has buttons for commits and pulls and such.

I enjoy D&D (Well, mostly Pathfinder), anime, and drawing! 
You can view some of my art on the art repository site Toyhouse: https://toyhou.se/JourneyThePanda/art
